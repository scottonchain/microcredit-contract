# Welcome to Decentralized Microcredit Platform Contributing Guide

Thank you for investing your time in contributing to the Decentralized Microcredit Platform!

This guide aims to provide an overview of the contribution workflow to help us make the contribution process effective for everyone involved.

## About the Project

The Decentralized Microcredit Platform is a peer-to-peer micro-lending application on the Ethereum network that enables collateral-free loans backed by social reputation rather than traditional credit history.

Read the [README](README.md) to get an overview of the project.

### Vision

The goal of this project is to democratize access to credit through:
- **Social attestations and PageRank-based credit scoring** (all on-chain)
- **Fixed-rate loans** based on real economic indicators (EFFR + risk premium)
- **Unified lending pool** with proportional yield distribution
- **Attester incentives** for maintaining network quality

### Project Status

The project is under active development with a focus on:
- Smart contract optimization and security
- Frontend user experience improvements
- Oracle integration enhancements
- Testing and documentation

## Getting Started

You can contribute to this repo in many ways:

- Solve open issues
- Report bugs or feature requests
- Improve smart contract efficiency
- Enhance frontend user experience
- Improve documentation
- Add test coverage

Contributions are made via Issues and Pull Requests (PRs). A few general guidelines for contributions:

- Search for existing Issues and PRs before creating your own.
- Contributions should only fix/add the functionality in the issue OR address style issues, not both.
- If you're running into an error, please give context. Explain what you're trying to do and how to reproduce the error.
- Please use the same formatting in the code repository. You can configure your IDE to do it by using the prettier / linting config files included in each package.
- If applicable, please edit the README.md file to reflect the changes.

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites
- `git`, `node >=18`, `yarn`
- Foundry (`curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash`)

### Local Development
1. **Clone & install**
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd microcredit-contract
yarn install
```

2. **Run a local chain**
```bash
yarn chain
```

3. **Deploy contracts with test data**
```bash
# For development/testing (includes MockUSDC)
DEPLOY_MOCK_USDC=true yarn deploy

# For production-like testing (no MockUSDC)
yarn deploy
```

4. **Launch the frontend**
```bash
yarn start
```

### Environment Configuration
Create `packages/nextjs/.env.local` for frontend overrides:
```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_TARGET_NETWORK=localhost
NEXT_PUBLIC_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=<DecentralizedMicrocredit address>
NEXT_PUBLIC_USDC_ADDRESS=<MockUSDC address>
```

## Testing

### Smart Contract Tests
```bash
# Run all tests
yarn foundry:test

# Run specific tests
cd packages/foundry
forge test --match-test testLoanApproval -vv

# Run tests with gas reporting
forge test --gas-report
```

### Frontend Testing
```bash
# Type checking
yarn next:check-types

# Linting
yarn next:lint
```

## Deployment Considerations

### Local Demo vs Production â€“ Important Notes ðŸ›‘

This repository includes demo helpers for local development. **These are NOT meant for production deployments.**

**Important Security Notes:**
- `packages/foundry/script/Deploy.s.sol` contains hard-coded private keys for Anvil development chains only
- Never run deployment scripts with hard-coded keys on public networks
- The `DEPLOY_MOCK_USDC=true` flag is for testing only
- Production deployments require proper USDC contract addresses

**Best Practices:**
- Always use `DEPLOY_MOCK_USDC=true` for local testing
- Run `forge clean` before compilation after major changes
- Use keystore accounts for testnet/mainnet deployments
- Verify contract addresses in `deployment.json` after deployment

## Code Style and Conventions

### Smart Contracts
- Follow Solidity style guide and OpenZeppelin patterns
- Use meaningful variable names (e.g., `loanAmount` not `amt`)
- Add comprehensive NatSpec documentation
- Prefer explicit over implicit operations
- Use custom errors instead of string reverts

### Frontend
- Use shared formatting helpers from `packages/nextjs/utils/format.ts`
- Reuse components from `packages/nextjs/components/` instead of duplicating
- Follow Next.js 14 App Router conventions
- Use TypeScript strictly (no `any` types)
- Prefer server components when possible

### Testing
- Write descriptive test names that explain the scenario
- Use arrange-act-assert pattern
- Test both happy paths and edge cases
- Include fuzz testing for mathematical operations

## Issues

Issues should be used to report problems, request new features, or discuss potential changes before a PR is created.

### Creating Issues
When creating an issue, please:
- Use a clear and descriptive title
- Provide context about what you were trying to achieve
- Include steps to reproduce for bugs
- Add screenshots or videos when helpful
- Label appropriately (bug, enhancement, documentation, etc.)

### Issue Labels
- `bug` - Something isn't working
- `enhancement` - New feature or improvement
- `documentation` - Documentation updates needed
- `smart-contract` - Contract-related issues
- `frontend` - UI/UX related issues
- `testing` - Test coverage or testing issues
