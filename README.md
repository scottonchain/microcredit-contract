## üìñ Usage Guide

### For Borrowers
1. **Get Attested**: Ask trusted contacts to vouch for your creditworthiness
2. **Check Credit Score**: View your current credit score on the Scores page
3. **Request Loan**: Use the Borrow page to request a loan with desired terms
4. **Repay Loan**: Use the Repay page to make payments before the due date

### For Lenders
1. **Deposit Funds**: Add USDC to the lending pool via the Lend page
2. **Fund Loans**: Automatically participate in loan funding based on available funds
3. **Earn Yield**: Receive interest payments when loans are repaid
4. **Withdraw Funds**: Remove funds from the lending pool when needed

### For Attesters
1. **Make Attestations**: Vouch for borrowers' creditworthiness on the Attest page
2. **Earn Rewards**: Receive rewards when attested borrowers successfully repay loans
3. **Build Reputation**: Your attestations contribute to the overall credit scoring system

### For Admins/Oracles
1. **Update Credit Scores**: Use the Admin panel to update user credit scores
2. **Batch Updates**: Update multiple credit scores at once
3. **Monitor System**: View system statistics and loan status

## Key Features Explained

### PageRank Credit Scoring
The system uses a modified PageRank algorithm to calculate credit scores based on:
- Social attestations between users
- Attestation weights and confidence levels
- Network topology and reputation propagation
- Successful loan repayment history

### Dynamic Interest Rates
Interest rates are calculated based on credit scores:
- Higher credit scores = lower interest rates
- Configurable minimum and maximum rates
- Automatic rate calculation for each loan request

### Lending Pool Mechanics
- **Proportional Funding**: Loans are funded proportionally from all available lender funds
- **Yield Distribution**: Interest is distributed to lenders based on their share of the loan
- **Platform Fees**: Small percentage taken from interest for platform maintenance
- **Liquidity Management**: Lenders can deposit and withdraw funds freely

### Social Attestation System
- **Weighted Attestations**: Attesters can assign confidence levels (0-100%)
- **Reward System**: Attesters earn rewards when their attested borrowers repay successfully
- **Reputation Backpropagation**: Successful repayments improve attester reputation
- **Network Effects**: Attestations create a trust network that benefits all participants

## üîí Security Features

- **Reentrancy Protection**: All external calls are protected against reentrancy attacks
- **Access Control**: Oracle functions are restricted to authorized addresses
- **Input Validation**: All user inputs are validated for safety
- **Overflow Protection**: Uses SafeMath patterns and proper bounds checking
- **Emergency Controls**: Owner can update critical parameters if needed

## üìà Future Enhancements

- **Credit Score History**: Track credit score changes over time
- **Advanced Analytics**: Dashboard with lending/borrowing analytics
- **Mobile App**: React Native mobile application
- **Cross-Chain Support**: Multi-chain deployment
- **DAO Governance**: Community governance for platform parameters
- **Insurance Pool**: Optional insurance for lenders against defaults
